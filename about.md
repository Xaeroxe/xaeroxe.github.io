Hi! I've been programming and writing games since 2010. Right now in my free time I'm working on the Amethyst game engine as well as a separate undisclosed videogame project.

Here's a quick chronology of things I've worked with/on, starting with my most recent work

- [Amethyst Game Engine](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) Organization Member
- Custom built ASP.net SQL powered website for internal use at [Workforce QA](https://www.wfqa.com/)
- [Nitro Game Engine](https://github.com/Xaeroxe/nitro-game-engine/) Sole Author
- [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/) I used this for several game prototypes
- Wrote a custom C++ engine based on [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and [MyGUI](http://mygui.info/).
- Minecraft modding. I wrote some mods to enhance the combat of Minecraft.
- [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com) I used this for several game prototypes
